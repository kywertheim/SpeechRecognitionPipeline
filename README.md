# SpeechRecognitionPipeline

I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Communicating with Natural Language. The Jupyter notebook vui_notebook.ipynb presents the procedures I followed to build the acoustic model in an automatic speech recognition pipeline. I experimented with different arrangements of 1D convolutional, GRU, and time-distributed dense layers, as well as techniques such as batch normalisation, dropout, and gradient clipping.
